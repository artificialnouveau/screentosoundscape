                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Sound Guide — What You Hear in the Soundscape</h3>
                    <p>The real-time demo uses several layers of spatial audio to help you navigate and understand the article structure:</p>

                    <h4>Core Audio</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Section speech</strong> — When you approach a sphere, the section's text is read aloud using text-to-speech. Volume scales with distance — closer sections are louder, distant ones are quieter. The voice changes based on element type: titles use a deep, slow voice (low pitch); section headers have a slightly higher pitch; subsection headers higher still; and paragraphs use a natural speaking voice. This lets you distinguish element types by ear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Images and tables</strong> — Image captions/alt-text and table data are extracted from the Wikipedia article and included in the soundscape, so visual content is not skipped.</li>
                        <li><strong>Beacon tones</strong> — Each sphere emits a quiet, looping tone so you can locate it by ear. The pitch indicates hierarchy:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Low tone (130 Hz) — Article title</li>
                                <li>Mid-low tone (220 Hz) — Main sections (H2 headings)</li>
                                <li>Mid tone (330 Hz) — Subsections (H3 headings)</li>
                                <li>Higher tone (440 Hz) — Paragraphs</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Auto-announce</strong> — As you approach a section sphere (within about 5 units), its heading is spoken automatically.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ambient background</strong> — A soft, layered drone plays continuously, combining low-frequency tones (55 Hz, 82.5 Hz, 110 Hz) with gentle filtered noise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Section ambiences</strong> — Each major section has its own subtle ambient texture, creating audio "neighborhoods" that change as you move through the article.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boundary sound</strong> — A percussive "bump" sound plays when you reach the edge of the scene.</li>
                        <li><strong>Welcome audio</strong> — On first entry, an instruction audio plays. Double-tap Space (or the pause button on mobile) to hear a welcome message.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Footstep Audio</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Surface-responsive footsteps</strong> — As you move, footstep sounds play at regular intervals. The sound character changes based on your position: softer near the introduction (like grass), harder in deeper sections (like stone).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Navigation &amp; Orientation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"Where am I?" (Tab key)</strong> — Press Tab to hear a spoken summary of your position: which section is nearest, and how many sections are to your left, right, and ahead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Return to start (Escape key)</strong> — Press Escape to teleport back to where you first landed. Useful if you get lost in a large article.</li>
                        <li><strong>Breadcrumb trail</strong> — Visited spheres change color (dimmed) so you can visually track where you've been. A quiet click plays when you revisit an already-visited section.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Layout &amp; Structure</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Linear path layout</strong> — Elements are arranged along a straight forward path. Walk forward to progress through the article in reading order: title → introduction → section headers → paragraphs → subsections. Headers sit on the left, paragraphs offset to the right, and subsections are indented — creating a visual reading structure as you move through the space.</li>
                        <li><strong>All at ear level</strong> — All elements (title, sections, subsections, paragraphs) are placed at the same height (y=1.6) for consistent audio. This ensures you can hear every element equally as you walk through the scene.</li>
                        <li><strong>Content-length shapes</strong> — Headers appear as spheres, while paragraphs appear as horizontal cylinders whose length reflects the amount of text. Short paragraphs are short cylinders; long paragraphs stretch out, giving a visual and spatial sense of how much content each section contains.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wikipedia article panel</strong> — The original Wikipedia article is displayed in a panel at the top of the screen. As you approach and play sections, the corresponding text is highlighted in green and auto-scrolled into view, letting you see exactly where you are in the article.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Interactive Features</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Auto-advance</strong> — When the current element finishes speaking and you haven't moved, the camera gently drifts toward the next element in reading order (header → its paragraph → next header → its paragraph, and so on). A brief "Next: [section name]" announcement plays as you begin drifting. Move any arrow key or touch the screen to cancel the drift and take manual control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Play all by distance (P key)</strong> — Press P to hear all text elements read aloud sequentially, starting with the nearest. Volume is based on distance — closer sections are louder, farther ones quieter. Press P again to stop.</li>
                        <li><strong>Link portals</strong> — Wikipedia links from the article appear as magenta spinning spheres at the edges of the scene. Walking into a portal announces the linked article title. Press Enter to load it as a new soundscape, or simply walk away to stay on the current page.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Keyboard Controls</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> — Move around the 3D space</li>
                        <li><strong>Space</strong> — Play/pause audio</li>
                        <li><strong>Double-tap Space</strong> — Play welcome message</li>
                        <li><strong>Shift</strong> — Play nearest sound</li>
                        <li><strong>Tab</strong> — "Where am I?" position summary</li>
                        <li><strong>P</strong> — Play all elements by distance (toggle on/off)</li>
                        <li><strong>Enter</strong> — Load a portal link if near one</li>
                        <li><strong>Escape</strong> — Return to starting position</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3>Feedback from first co-creation</h3>
                    <p>Users appreciated the spatial layout but needed stronger auditory boundary indicators. Key findings included the need for clearer navigation cues and better orientation feedback.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Reflection on the first co-creation -->
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Reflection on the first co-creation</h3>
                    <p>The team learned that traditional screen readers often "flatten" web experiences by reducing content to linear lists, eliminating spatial context crucial for understanding complex information like maps or images. This insight drove the development of enhanced spatial audio features.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Design of the second prototype -->
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Design of the second prototype</h3>
                    <p>The second prototype added enhanced audio boundaries, refined sound parameters, and adjusted distance modeling. Additional keyboard controls were implemented to give users more agency in navigation.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Feedback from the second co-creation -->
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Feedback from the second co-creation</h3>
                    <p>The refined prototype received positive feedback for its improved boundary audio and control options. Users noted that the enhanced sound design made navigation more intuitive and less disorienting.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Reflection on the second co-creation -->
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Reflection on the second co-creation</h3>
                    <p>Co-creators valued control over voice characteristics, sound localization, and movement within soundscapes. While exploration appealed to participants, they highlighted difficulties navigating without clear auditory cues and complexity from multiple layered voices.</p>
